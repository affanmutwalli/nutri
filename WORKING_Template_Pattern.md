# ðŸ”§ Working Template Pattern

## âœ… **What Works (Confirmed)**

Your `order_placed_prepaid` template works perfectly:
- âœ… **Language:** `en` (not en_US)
- âœ… **Category:** MARKETING
- âœ… **API Response:** Success

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recreate order_shipped Using Exact Same Pattern**

### **Step 1: Delete Current Template**
1. Go to Interakt Dashboard
2. Find `order_shipped` template
3. **Delete it completely**

### **Step 2: Create New Template with Working Pattern**

**Copy this EXACTLY:**

```
Template Name: order_shipped_v2
Category: MARKETING
Language: English (en)
Header Type: TEXT
Header Text: ðŸ“¦ Your Order is Shipped!

Body Text:
Hi {{1}}, 

Great news! Your order #{{2}} has been shipped and is on its way to you.

ðŸ“‹ Tracking Number: {{3}}
ðŸšš You can track your package using the tracking number above.

Thank you for choosing My Nutrify! ðŸŒ¿

Footer: My Nutrify - Your Health Partner
```

### **Sample Content (Use EXACTLY these values):**
- **{{1}}:** `Test Customer`
- **{{2}}:** `ORD12345` 
- **{{3}}:** `DL987654321IN`

### **Step 3: Update PHP Code**

Once approved, update the template name in your code:
```php
// Change from:
"name" => "order_shipped",

// To:
"name" => "order_shipped_v2",
```

Subject: Template Sync Issue - Approved Template Not Available via API

Hi Interakt Support,

I have a template sync issue:

Template Details:
- Name: order_shipped
- Status: Approved in dashboard
- Category: Marketing
- Language: English (en)

Issue:
- Template shows as approved in dashboard
- API returns: "No approved template found with name 'order_shipped' and language 'en'"
- Other templates (order_placed_prepaid) work fine

Request:
Please force sync this template or advise on resolution.

Account: [Your account email]
Template Screenshot: [Attach screenshot of approved template]

Thank you,
[Your name]
```

## ðŸš€ **Quick Test After Changes**

Use this URL to test immediately:
```
http://localhost/nutrify/check_template_status.php
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Why This Happens**

Common causes:
1. **Backend sync delay** - Dashboard updates faster than API backend
2. **Template validation issues** - Something in template content
3. **Cache issues** - Interakt's internal caching
4. **Account permissions** - API access limitations

## âœ… **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
1. Template checker shows âœ… SUCCESS
2. API returns `"result": true`
3. You get a message ID in response

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps Priority**

1. **First:** Try template sync in dashboard
2. **Second:** Recreate template as `order_shipped_v2`
3. **Third:** Contact Interakt support
4. **Fourth:** Wait 24 hours and retry

The fact that `order_placed_prepaid` works means your setup is correct - it's just a sync issue! ðŸš€
