## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **UTILITY** templates have higher delivery rates than MARKETING
- **MARKETING** templates may have sending limits
- **AUTHENTICATION** templates are for OTPs only
- Always use the correct category for better approval chances

The main issue was the category mismatch - order status updates should definitely be UTILITY, not MARKETING!
